    <h1>Hi! I'm Jacob ðŸ‘‹</h1>

    <section>
      <p>I like the Internet, tech, music and code.</p>
      <p>
        I live in lovely

        >Copenhagen</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work as a Lead Engineer at <a href="https://lego.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEGO</a>, building cool digital products for grown-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to work with politics, then I worked with marketing. Some would
        say that's the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I write code for a living and build products and websites. For work
        and for fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and React, and I've built a
        few apps with React Native.
      </p>
      <p>
        I occassionally dabble in Python, and I'm also dipping my toes into languages like .NET, Swift and Rust.

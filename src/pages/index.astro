    <p>I like the tech, urbanism, music and code.</p>
    <p>
      I live in lovely

        rel="noopener noreferrer">Copenhagen</a

    </p>
    <p>
      I work as a Lead Engineer at <a

    <p>
      I used to work with politics, then I worked with marketing. Some would say
      that's the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I write code for a living and build products and websites. For work
      and for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and React, and I've built a few
      apps with React Native.
    </p>
    <p>
      I occassionally dabble in Python, and I'm also dipping my toes into
      languages like .NET, Swift and Rust.
